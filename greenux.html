          <b class='title' > What is Green UX? </b>
          <p1>  Did you know that if the Internet were a country, it would rank third place in global energy consumption? <em>Crazy right?</em> That's why it
            is really important for UX designers to think about going greener. <br> <br><br>

            <em> So how can you go greener? By changing... </em><br><br><br>



 <div class='subtitle'> #1 Your hoster </div> <br>
Your hoster uses green electricity and is energy efficient. My favorites are currently Biohost and greensta. If you consider that with
standard electricity 475g CO2e/kWh are emitted
and with electricity from renewable resources only 33.4g CO2e/kWh, I think that’s pretty sweet (with some dependencies of course).*


<br> <br><br> <div class='subtitle'> #2 Your technical setup </div> <br>
Your technical setup is as data efficient as possible. This includes the compression of CSS and JavaScript, but also the use of caching or
 avoiding cookies and many requests and redirects. If you use WordPress, there are many cool plugins and themes with great performance.


<br> <br><br> <div class='subtitle'>#3 Your content </div> <br>
Your content is just as data-efficient as the technical setup. You use pictures and videos when really needed, compress them and don’t
let the videos play via autoplay. You use system fonts (#arialforreal) and optimize your click paths. We’re not in a supermarket where the
shelves are placed in such a way that you have to walk through them all to do your shopping. As I said, every click causes more CO2. And
maybe you are already trying to reduce that with other parts of your business or your products. Then talk about it in detail and let it flow into your content.


<br> <br><br><div class='subtitle'>#4 Your emails</div> <br>
Your email signature is just text (no pictures) and your newsletter is mainly text (few pictures). Most recipients have turned off the
automatic display of pictures anyway and see only white boxes. Some recipients just delete your emails or mark them as spam because they are
too lazy to unsubscribe or haven’t found a way to do so. Throw them out. They just shrink your opening rate and thus “intelligent” mailboxes don’t display your emails.



<br> <br> <br><div class='subtitle'>#5 Your partners </div> <br>
You take a look at what your suppliers and cooperation partners are doing. Are they sustainable? What do they do for the climate? Create
 awareness or find other partners. Also in your direct environment.


<br> <br> <br> <div class='subtitle'>#6 Your digital office </div> <br>
How green is the hosting of your cloud? Tip: Dropbox and Adobe are not. Do you use Ecosia as your search engine? How often do you sort out
emails and your files? Do you need so many file versions in your archive? What about digital to-do lists? Do you include our beautiful blue
planet Earth in your design processes? For example as a persona or target customer? If not, feel free to try it out. For me it was a real game changer.



<br><br>
<br><br>
<b class='subtitle'> So what are the benefits of Green UX design? </b> <br><br>
Because we try to keep the amount of data as small as possible, your website will have a super minimal loading time, which means a faster
 site, happy users, more purchases, a better ranking in search engines (because they reward us for the low loading time) and better findability.
 Well, I think that’s pretty great.
